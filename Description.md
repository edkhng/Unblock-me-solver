Unblock Me is a mobile game by Kira Games that contains numerous puzzles of different difficulty. The puzzle involves blocks that 
are 2 units or 3 units long, oriented vertically or horizontally placed in a 6x6 grid. The blocks can only move parallel to their orientation. 
There is a single red block in the puzzle oriented horizontally, and an opening in the right edge of the grid with a width of 1 unit 
placed 2 units from the top of the grid and 3 from the bottom. The puzzle is complete when the red block can be moved into the opening
without any other blocks in the way.
